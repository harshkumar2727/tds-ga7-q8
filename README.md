## Data Visualization

A line chart visualizes quarterly scores, the industry benchmark, and the company’s average for 2024:

***

## Key Findings

- The company’s **average annual score is 4.66**, slightly above the target, but marked by significant quarter-to-quarter volatility.
- **Q1 and Q4 scores fall well below the industry benchmark,** indicating periods of poor patient experience.
- **Q2 and Q3 exceed the industry target,** showing that excellent service is possible, but not sustained.
- **Pattern:** Performance is not consistent across the year, putting patient trust and company reputation at risk.

***

## Business Implications

- Inconsistent service quality poses a risk to patient loyalty and brand trust.
- Failing to meet the industry benchmark in half the quarters can lead to **competitive disadvantage** and scrutiny from partners and regulators.
- There is a risk of patient attrition if corrective action is not taken.

## Recommendations for Reaching a 4.5+ Target

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate operational issues or external events behind low scores in Q1 and Q4, such as staffing shortages, workflow bottlenecks, or policy changes.
2. **Improve Service Quality:** Implement staff training, increase recognition for high performers, and standardize patient experience best practices.
3. **Reduce Wait Times:** Optimize scheduling, leverage real-time patient flow monitoring, and deploy resources dynamically during peak periods.
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Set up quarterly performance feedback loops and rapid intervention protocols.
5. **Transparent Communication:** Share improvement efforts with patients and staff to reinforce a culture of responsiveness and care.
