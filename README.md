**Contact:** 23ds3000170@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

***

## Overview

This project analyzes the 2024 quarterly patient satisfaction scores for our healthcare company, benchmarking against the industry target of 4.5. The findings and recommendations here directly guide strategic decisions and resource allocation for the next fiscal year.

***

## Dataset

| Quarter | Patient Satisfaction Score |
| :-- | :-- |
| Q1 | 1.57 |
| Q2 | 6.19 |
| Q3 | 7.47 |
| Q4 | 3.39 |

- **Average Score (2024):** 4.66
- **Industry Target:** 4.5

***

## Key Findings

- **Volatility:** Scores ranged widely, with significant lows in Q1 (1.57) and Q4 (3.39), and peaks in Q2 (6.19) and Q3 (7.47).
- **Average Performance:** The annual average (4.66) slightly exceeds the industry benchmark, but inconsistent delivery is a concern.
- **Benchmark Variance:** Industry target was only met in Q2 and Q3.

## Business Implications

- **Inconsistent service quality:** Abrupt dips, especially in Q1 and Q4, risk eroding patient trust, loyalty, and brand reputation.
- **Competitive risk:** Sustained underperformance below industry standard could impact market position and regulatory compliance.

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Fluctuations:** Analyze root causes for the low performance quarters, such as staffing issues, workflow bottlenecks, or external events.
2. **Enhance Service Quality:** Conduct focused staff training and implement best-practices in patient interaction, particularly ahead of traditionally low-performing periods.
3. **Reduce Wait Times:** Optimize patient flow management using real-time data to minimize delays at critical touchpoints.
4. **Continuous Feedback:** Establish rapid-cycle feedback and intervention mechanisms to address satisfaction dips in real time.
5. **Transparent Communication:** Update patients and staff regularly on changes and improvements to reinforce a culture of quality and responsiveness.

## Code

All code for data preparation, analysis, and visualization can be found in the repository. The core script is implemented in Python using pandas and matplotlib for analysis and plotting.
